# Project Description
I will be building a tool for interested home buyers in the Los Angles area to help them in their homebuying journey. I will build a website where users can create a profile and input features and create a list of homes they are intrested in. Profiles will take in as input certain characteristics about the user(Expected monthly income, credit score, money available for down payment, etc). From there, this tool will curate an action plan that user can take for each house they are intrested in buying.
